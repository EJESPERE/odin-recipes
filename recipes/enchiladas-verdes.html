    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p class="discp">An enchilada is a Mexican dish that's made from tortillas wrapped around meat or cheese, and cooked in a spicy sauce. The earliest enchiladas were simply a plain tortilla served with chili sauce.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ pounds small green tomatillos, husks removed</li>
        <li>3 serrano peppers</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>9 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons chicken bouillon granules</li>
        <li>½ store-bought rotisserie chicken, meat removed and shredded</li>
        <li>¼ head iceberg lettuce, shredded</li>
        <li>1 cup cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container Mexican crema, crema fresca</li>
        <li>1 cup grated cotija cheese</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Cover a large griddle with aluminum foil and preheat to medium-high.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Cook tomatillos, serrano peppers, and garlic on the hot griddle, turning occasionally, until toasted and blackened — about 5 minutes for garlic, 10 minutes for peppers, and 15 minutes for tomatillos. Remove to a bowl and allow to cool.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Heat oil in a small, deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Lightly fry tortillas, one at a time, in hot oil until warmed through, 3 to 5 seconds per side. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Place toasted tomatillos, serrano peppers, and garlic in a blender. Add water and blend until smooth; pour into a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Dissolve chicken bouillon in the mixture, reduce heat, and cook at a simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.</p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>Soak tortillas in sauce, one at a time, for a few seconds. Fill each tortilla with shredded chicken and sprinkle with sauce. Roll up tortillas and place seam-side down in a serving dish.</p>
    <h4>Step 7</h4>
    <p>Spoon a generous amount of sauce over rolled tortillas. Top with lettuce, cilantro, crema, and cotija cheese. Pour remaining sauce on top or serve on the side.</p>
